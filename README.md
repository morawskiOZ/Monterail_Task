# Monterail Task
The idea was to create UI for events form. Including some custom inputs and validation.

Project written in TypeScript using React library. Styling is done with SCSS and Bem terminology. 
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
React-final-form was used for form state managment.
